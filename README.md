# BofhContract V2 🚀

An advanced smart contract implementation for executing multi-path token swaps, leveraging cutting-edge mathematical optimization techniques and robust security features. 🛡️

## Theoretical Foundation 📚

### Arbitrage Theory and Implementation

The contract implements a sophisticated approach to arbitrage detection and execution based on several key theoretical foundations:

#### 1. Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) Theory 📊

The fundamental equation governing AMM pools is:
```
x * y = k
```
where x and y are token reserves, and k is the constant product. Our implementation extends this to handle multi-hop paths by analyzing the composite function:

```
f(x1, ..., xn) = ∏i (xi * yi = ki)
```

#### 2. Optimal Path Execution 🎯

The contract employs advanced path optimization techniques based on the following theoretical frameworks:

##### a) Golden Ratio Optimization (φ)

For n-way paths, we utilize the golden ratio (φ ≈ 0.618034) to optimize trade splits. The mathematical basis is derived from the solution to:

```
min f(x) = ∑i (1/xi), subject to ∏i xi = 1
```

This yields optimal splits of:
- 4-way: [φ, φ2, φ3, 1-φ-φ2-φ3]
- 5-way: [φ2, φ3, φ4, φ5, 1-∑φi]

##### b) Dynamic Programming Implementation 🔄

Path optimization utilizes the Bellman equation:
```
V(s) = max_{a∈A} {R(s,a) + γV(s')}
```
where:
- V(s): Value function at state s
- R(s,a): Reward for action a in state s
- γ: Discount factor
- s': Next state

#### 3. Price Impact Analysis 📉

Our price impact calculations incorporate advanced mathematical models:

##### a) Slippage Estimation

Using third-order Taylor expansion:
```
ΔP/P ≈ -λ(ΔR/R) + (λ2/2)(ΔR/R)2 - (λ3/6)(ΔR/R)3
```
where:
- ΔP: Price change
- ΔR: Reserve change
- λ: Market depth parameter

##### b) Volatility Tracking

Implements Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with dynamic α:
```
σt = α(t)rt2 + (1-α(t))σt−1
α(t) = 1 - exp(-Δt/τ)
```

## Architecture 🏗️

The project employs a modular architecture with specialized components:

### Mathematical Implementation Details 🧮

#### 1. Newton-Raphson Method for Root Finding

Our sqrt and cbrt implementations use an optimized Newton-Raphson method:
```solidity
function sqrt(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256 y) {
    if (x > 0x100000000000000000000000000000000) {
        y = x;
        uint256 z = (x + 1) / 2;
        while (z < y) {
            y = z;
            z = (x / z + z) / 2;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Geometric Mean Calculation

For path validation:
```solidity
function geometricMean(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return sqrt(a * b);
}
```

#### 3. Price Impact Calculation

Using cubic root approximation:
```solidity
function calculatePriceImpact(uint256 amountIn, PoolState memory pool) internal pure {
    uint256 k = pool.reserveIn * pool.reserveOut;
    uint256 newReserveIn = pool.reserveIn + amountIn;
    return cbrt((newK * PRECISION * PRECISION) / (k * PRECISION));
}
```

## Security Features 🔒

### 1. MEV Protection 🛡️

Implements sophisticated MEV protection mechanisms:

#### a) Sandwich Attack Detection

Uses statistical analysis to detect abnormal price movements:
```solidity
priceDeviation = ((actualPrice - expectedPrice) * PRECISION) / expectedPrice;
require(priceDeviation <= sandwichProtectionBips, "MEV Protection: High Price Deviation");
```

#### b) Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) 📊

Implements TWAP checks for price validation:
```solidity

```
