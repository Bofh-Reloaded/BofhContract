# BofhContract

BofhContract.sol implements on-chain execution of optimized swap paths with advanced mathematical optimizations.

## Advanced Multi-Way Swap Implementation

### Mathematical Foundations

1. Golden Ratio Optimization (4-Way Swaps)
   - Uses the golden ratio (φ ≈ 0.618034) for optimal trade splitting
   - Based on the principle that φ provides the most efficient division of trading volume
   - Minimizes price impact by maintaining optimal proportions between swaps
   - Formula: optimalAmount = currentAmount * φ

2. Dynamic Programming with Golden Ratio Squared (5-Way Swaps)
   - Uses φ2 ≈ 0.381966 for deeper paths
   - Implements dynamic programming for historical amount tracking
   - Adjusts tolerance based on path position using inverse golden ratio
   - Formula: tolerance = 1 + ((position + 1) * (1-φ)) / 5

3. Geometric Mean Price Impact
   - Uses geometric mean to validate swap efficiency
   - Formula: expectedOutput = √(previousAmount * currentAmount)
   - Provides more stable price impact assessment than arithmetic mean

4. Advanced Price Impact Calculation
   ```solidity
   function calculatePriceImpact(amountIn, pool) {
       k = reserveIn * reserveOut
       newReserveIn = reserveIn + amountIn
       newK = newReserveIn * reserveOut
       impactCubed = (newK * 1e6 * 1e6) / (k * 1e6)
       return cbrt(impactCubed)
   }
   ```

### Performance Optimizations

1. Four-Way Path Optimization
   - Initial split using golden ratio (φ)
   - Geometric mean validation at each step
   - Cumulative impact tracking
   - Maximum 4% total slippage (1% per swap)

2. Five-Way Path Optimization
   - Initial split using golden ratio squared (φ2)
   - Dynamic programming for historical tracking
   - Progressive tolerance adjustment
   - Maximum 5% total slippage (1% per swap)

3. Memory Optimization
   - Fixed-size arrays for historical data
   - Efficient struct packing
   - Minimal storage operations
   - Optimized calldata access

### Technical Implementation

1. Advanced Data Structures
   ```solidity
   struct SwapState {
       address transitToken;
       uint256 currentAmount;
       bool isLastSwap;
       uint256 amountInWithFee;
       uint256 amountOut;
       uint256 slippage;
       uint256 optimalityScore;
       uint256 pathLength;
       uint256 cumulativeImpact;
       uint256 volumeProfile;
   }
   ```

2. Pool Analysis
   ```solidity
   struct PoolState {
       uint256 reserveIn;
       uint256 reserveOut;
       bool sellingToken0;
       address tokenOut;
       uint256 priceImpact;
       uint256 depth;
       uint256 volatility;
   }
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Four-Way Swap
```solidity
function fourWaySwap(uint256[4] calldata args) external
```
Optimized for medium-length paths using golden ratio:
- args[0..2]: Pool addresses with fees
- args[3]: Initial and expected amounts

### Five-Way Swap
```solidity
function fiveWaySwap(uint256[5] calldata args) external
```
Optimized for longer paths using dynamic programming:
- args[0..3]: Pool addresses with fees
- args[4]: Initial and expected amounts

## Parameter Encoding

The array structure follows this semantic scheme:

    args[0..N-1] --> poolData (address + fee)
    args[N] --> amountData

    poolData = (feePPM << 160) | poolAddress
    amountData = initialAmount | (expectedAmount << 128)

Each implementation is optimized for its specific path length with:
- Path-specific mathematical optimizations
- Custom safety checks
- Gas-efficient execution
- Price impact minimization
